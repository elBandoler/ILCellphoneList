# ILCellphoneList
A console application (.NET Framework 4.7.2) that creates a text file that contains a list of all possible cellphone numbers in Israel.

Yeah, I know. .NET Framework? Why?
Well, I needed this ASAP, my brain wanted C#, I just randomally chose the Framework and not Core, I don't even know why.
It works perfectly and can be easily modded to any other list of numbers.
I honestly recommend not to use it for any purpose as I literally wrote it in 10 minutes including "tests".
It's always better to write your own code when dealing with such simple tasks, and it's also more fun :)
